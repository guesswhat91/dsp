### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

1. _**'pwd'**_ =  Print Working Directory  
2. _**'mkdir'**_ = short for Make Directory  
3. _**'rmdir'**_ = removes directory  
4. _**'touch'**_ = creates an  empty file  
5. _**'rm'**_ = removes file from directory  
6. _**'mv'**_ = moves files from one directory to another (_Example: mv ~/Documents/lee_personal/work/test1.txt ~/Documents/lee_personal/work/test2.txt_)  
7. _**'ls -a**_ = List all the hidden files too. Any files starting with a dot in front of it is a hidden file
8. _**'cp'**_ = stands for copy.(_Example: cp ~/Documents/lee_personal/work/temp/test1.txt ~/Documents/lee_personal/work/test2.txt_)  
9. _**'wc'**_ = Stands for word count  
    _ _'wc -l'_ = will give the number of lines  
    - _'wc -w'_ = will give the number of words  
    - _'wc -c'_ = will give the number of characters
